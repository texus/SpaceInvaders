Space Invaders
==============

This game was a university assignment.

It had to contain the following things:
  - Inheritance and polymorphism
  - Model-View-Controller design
  - Observer pattern
  - Abstract factory design pattern
  - Exception handling for errors
  - Design with namespaces
  - Usage of SFML


Compiling
---------

First of all, you will need a compiler with decent c++11 support.
This project was only tested with gcc 4.8.

Compiling the game on linux is a piece of cake:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make install
